# Problem Statement

# Write a program that prints the first 20 even numbers. There are several correct approaches, but they all use a loop of some sort. Do no write twenty print statements

# The first even number is 0:
# 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38

# Solution

def print_even_numbers():
    count = 20  
    for i in range(count):  
        print(i * 2, end=" ")  

print_even_numbers()
